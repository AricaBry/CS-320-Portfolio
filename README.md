# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by creating Unit tests that align with the systemâ€™s requirements. When working with JUnit testing, I work to ensure my projects reach at least %80 to %90 overall code coverage. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into the program by taking note of system requirements and functionality. I like to break them down and write them on a piece of paper and slowly check them off one by one as I progress. Listing the requirements means I won't skip over any funcitonality and the system will function based on the user's needs.

# How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software starts with first taking an overall look at what the requirements for the system are. Then I will design my test cases based on these requirements. Each specific test case is implemented into the program after the relevant code has first been created. Working on these steps one at a time ensures I do not progress too far into the project without testing along the way. It reduces the risk of potential errors that will be difficult to locate and fix late into the project.
